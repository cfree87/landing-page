Sustainable Fashion

For my project I wanted to create a site that is easily found when searching for sustainable fashion. With this project I hope to provide education, reasoning, and resources for a potential consumer to consider and explore sustainable fashion. The intended consumer is interested in product sustainability and ethical trade.

In exploring the site the visitor should learn a bit about sustainable materials, companies to purchase from, and be provided with an educational video. The site also includes a form to sign up for a fictional newsletter in which I imagine a hypothetical monthly newsletter with relavant information.
